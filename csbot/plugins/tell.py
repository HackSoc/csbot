        Stores a message for a user to be delivered when the user is next in the channel.

        Usage:
        !tell <user> <message>

        Example:
        > TestUser  [13:37] | !tell Haegin You are awesome.
        > Bot       [13:37] | TestUser, I'll let Haegin know.

        - We need to handle messages which are just long enough to fit in one message when
            saved but too long when the citation and time is added.
